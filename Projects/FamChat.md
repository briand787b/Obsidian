# FamChat
* The way a person communicates to another person depnds on the nature of the relationship with that person
* The types of these relationships are of a finite range
* Optimizations can be made for the nature of these relationships:
	* e.g. Formal text is preferred for text-completion to elder family members
	* e.g. Swear filters are only engaged for elder family members
	* e.g. Auto-reply enabled for certain phrases (Happy Birthday)
