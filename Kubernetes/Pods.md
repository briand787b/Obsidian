# Pods
The atomic unit of deployment in Kubernetes.  Pods may consist of 1 or more containers.  

## Definitions
* Scheduling - The assignment of the pod to a node. Even if it fails, this instance of the pod is never moved to other nodes, as is the case with CPU processes, but a new pod instance may be created to replace it.
* 

## Mental Model
Each pod can be thought of as a separate logical computer that contains one application.  The application can consist of a single process running in a container, or a main application process and additional supporting processes, each running in a separate container.

Each pod has its own IP, hostname, processes, network interfaces and other resources. Containers that are part of the same pod think that theyâ€™re the only ones running on the computer.

## Namespaces
All of the containers in a pod share network and UTS Linux namespaces.  Certain features are available when specific namesapces are shared:
* Network namespace: both containers use the same network interfaces, share the same IP address and port space
* UTS namespace: both see the same system hostname
